# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction Model

This project is a machine learning model that predicts the survival of passengers on the Titanic using data from the famous [Kaggle Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) competition.

## 📊 Overview

The goal of this project is to build a binary classification model that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features such as age, sex, ticket class, and more.

## 🧠 Model

We use a variety of classification algorithms including:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines
- Gradient Boosting

The model is trained and evaluated using scikit-learn.
